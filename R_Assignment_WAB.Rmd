R Assignment


--- installs packages from tidyverse
--- reads fang genotypes file into data frame
--- reads snp positions into data frame
--- selects SNP_ID, Chromosome, and Position columns to new data frame
--- filters genotypes to extract maize genotype data to new data frame, str_detect detects presence of match for desired specimen groups, filters those
--- filters genotypes to extract teosinte genotype data to new data frame, str_detect detects presence of match for desired specimen groups, filters those
--- removes header info from maize snps, transposes, defines as data frame, turns row names into columns, renames as SNP_ID to facilitate joining to snps
--- removes header info from teosinte snps, transposes, defines as data frame, turns row names into columns, renames as SNP_ID to facilitate joining to snps
--- merges SNP info with maize genotype data
--- merges SNP info with teosinte genotype data
