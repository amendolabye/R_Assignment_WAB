R Assignment


--- installs packages from tidyverse
--- reads fang genotypes file into data frame
--- reads snp positions into data frame
--- selects SNP_ID, Chromosome, and Position columns to new data frame
--- filters genotypes to extract maize genotype data to new data frame, str_detect detects presence of match for desired specimen groups, filters those
--- filters genotypes to extract teosinte genotype data to new data frame, str_detect detects presence of match for desired specimen groups, filters those
--- removes header info from maize snps, transposes, defines as data frame, turns row names into columns, renames as SNP_ID to facilitate joining to snps
--- removes header info from teosinte snps, transposes, defines as data frame, turns row names into columns, renames as SNP_ID to facilitate joining to snps
--- merges SNP info with maize genotype data
--- merges SNP info with teosinte genotype data
--- removes SNPs with multiple or unknown positions from maize SNPs
--- removes SNPs with multiple or unknown positions from teosinte SNPs
--- sorts maize SNPs by chromosome, then position ascending, numerically
--- sorts teosinte SNPs by chromosome, then position ascending, numerically
--- sorts maize SNPs by chromosome, then position descending, numerically to separate df 
--- sorts teosinte SNPs by chromosome, then position descending, numerically to separate df 

TODO
  maizesplit <- split(maize_snps, maize_snps$Chromosome)

for(i in names(maizesplit)) {
    assign(paste0("maize_", i), maizesplit[[i]])
}
  above functions split maize into separate data frames for each chromosome - run after sorting
  
  for other 10 files, will need to desc_maize_snps<-desc(maize_snps, as.numeric(Chromosome), as.numeric(Position)) and then split into desc_maize_i files - also need to replace ?/? with -/-
  
  working order 
  - split into files and print to .txt for each
  - take X_snps df (post removal of unknown/multiple), replace ?/? with -/-, sort descending, split into separate chr files, print to _desc.txt
  
  
  need to add data inspection to beginning
  need to do data visualization
