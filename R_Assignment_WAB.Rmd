R Assignment


--- installs packages from tidyverse
--- reads fang genotypes file into data frame
--- reads snp positions into data frame
--- selects SNP_ID, Chromosome, and Position columns to new data frame
--- filters genotypes to extract maize genotype data to new data frame, str_detect detects presence of match for desired specimen groups, filters those
--- filters genotypes to extract teosinte genotype data to new data frame, str_detect detects presence of match for desired specimen groups, filters those
--- removes header info from maize snps, transposes, defines as data frame, turns row names into columns, renames as SNP_ID to facilitate joining to snps
--- removes header info from teosinte snps, transposes, defines as data frame, turns row names into columns, renames as SNP_ID to facilitate joining to snps
--- merges SNP info with maize genotype data
--- merges SNP info with teosinte genotype data

maize_snps <- maize_snps[!apply(maize_snps, 1, function(row) any(row %in% c("multiple", "unknown"))), ]

  removes any row containing the value "multiple" or "unknown" leaving only snps with known chromosome and position
  
  maize_snps <- arrange(maize_snps, as.numeric(Chromosome), as.numeric(Position))

  sorts snps by chromosome numerically, then by position numerically
  
  maizesplit <- split(maize_snps, maize_snps$Chromosome)

for(i in names(maizesplit)) {
    assign(paste0("maize_", i), maizesplit[[i]])
}
  above functions split maize into separate data frames for each chromosome - run after sorting
  
  for other 10 files, will need to desc_maize_snps<-desc(maize_snps, as.numeric(Chromosome), as.numeric(Position)) and then split into desc_maize_i files - also need to replace ?/? with -/-
  
  working order 
  - remove multiple/unknown to X_snps df, sort ascending, split into files and print to .txt for each
  - take X_snps df (post removal of unknown/multiple), replace ?/? with -/-, sort descending, split into separate chr files, print to _desc.txt
  
  
  need to add data inspection to beginning
  need to do data visualization
  
  
  
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
fang_genos <- read_tsv("Data/fang_et_al_genotypes.txt")
snp_pos <- read_tsv("Data/snp_position.txt")
snps <- select(snp_pos, SNP_ID, Chromosome, Position)
maize_genos <- fang_genos %>% 
    filter(str_detect(Group, "ZMMIL|ZMMLR|ZMMMR"))
teosinte_genos <- fang_genos %>% 
    filter(str_detect(Group, "ZMPBA|ZMPIL|ZMPJA"))
maize_transposed <- rownames_to_column(as.data.frame(t(select(maize_genos, -(Sample_ID:Group)))), var = "SNP_ID")
teosinte_transposed <- rownames_to_column(as.data.frame(t(select(teosinte_genos, -(Sample_ID:Group)))), var = "SNP_ID")
maize_snps <- merge(snps, maize_transposed)
teosinte_snps <- merge(snps, teosinte_transposed)
```
