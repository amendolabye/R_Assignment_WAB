README

Working directory should be set to /R_Assignment_WAB.
Source data downloaded from course GitHub page.
Result chromosome files saved as .txt files in /Result_Files folder.
V1, V2, etc. in .txt files are column titles for each SNP entry - couldn't find a way to leave them blank. When read into a data frame (read_tsv) they appear as normal. 
Workflow information located in R_Assignment_WAB_FINAL.Rmd - running all chunks will generate result chromosome files and plots for assignment.
Plots saved as .png files in /Plots folder.
